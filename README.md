# Graphical Digital Clock in C

This is a real-time digital clock project written in **C** using the **graphics.h** library under the **Turbo C++** environment. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds in a graphical format, updating in real time.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To build a fully functional and visually appealing digital clock using basic programming logic and graphics functions in C. This project demonstrates how graphics can be integrated with real-time data using low-level programming.

---

## 🧾 Key Features

- Displays current system time: **HH:MM:SS**
- Real-time updates every second
- Uses `graphics.h` for graphical display
- Designed for **Turbo C++ / DOSBox** environment

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Compiler**: Turbo C++
- **Graphics Library**: graphics.h
- **Platform**: DOSBox or Turbo C++ IDE

---

## 📂 Files Included

- `digital_clock.cpp` – Main source file with full code
- `README.md` – Project documentation

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Retrieves system time using C/c++ time functions (`time.h`)
2. Extracts hour, minute, and second
3. Renders the time to screen using `graphics.h` functions
4. Refreshes every second using a loop with `delay()`

---

## 🚀 How to Run (Turbo C++)

1. Open Turbo C++ or run it via DOSBox.
2. Create a new project and paste the contents of `digital_clock.c`.
3. Make sure `graphics.h` is set up correctly.
4. Compile and run.

## 📘 Educational Value

- Reinforces core concepts: loops, time handling, function design
- Introduces simple **computer graphics** with C
- Demonstrates real-time system interaction
